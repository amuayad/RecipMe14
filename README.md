READ THIS BEFORE MAKING CHANGES TO THE PROJECT
------------------------------------

If you already have cloned the project to your local drive then you need to follow these steps
to avoid merge conflicts (when two or more people are working on the project at the same time
and editing the same line or do similar activities). 

1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote <br>

4. Fetch and merge from the remote again <br>
(in case new commits were made while you were working <br>
but only merge if there's new changes from the github repository) <br>
